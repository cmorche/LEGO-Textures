## 2024-05-23 - Image Optimization Strategy
**Learning:** Optimizing single, small assets (like individual minifigures) is often a micro-optimization with negligible impact.
**Action:** Prioritize shared, high-impact assets (e.g., headers, backgrounds) or batch optimizations of larger files to demonstrate measurable value. Always verify if the file is already optimized using `optipng -simulate`.

## 2024-05-23 - Binary File Verification
**Learning:** Modifying binary files (PNGs) requires careful verification.
**Action:** Always verify binary file integrity using the `file` command after optimization to ensure valid output before submission. The "Add comments" requirement does not apply to binary files.
